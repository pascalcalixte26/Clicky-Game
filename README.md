# Clicky-Game

The object of this game is to render twelve photos.  upon each click of each photo, the page reshuffles all the photos.  On each click as well, you get a point as long as you didn't click on the same photo twice.  If you click on a prior photo you clicked the round is over.  The object is to reach 12 points before starting another round.  

I was able to get the random sort of the photos to work as well as the increment of each click.  However, I wasn't able to figure out the logic to reject a duplicate click on the same photo to work as well as save the top score.
